# Estate-App

Estate-App is a fully functional real estate trading platform.

This is my first full-stack project with the MERN stack concept. I coded this project for learning purposes.

While working on this site, I benefited from a similar concept shared by Safak on YouTube. I didnâ€™t use some of the technologies he utilized and completed certain parts in my own way.

You can find Safak's GitHub account here: [Safak's GitHub](https://github.com/safak)

## Technologies Used

The system was built using the following technologies:

- **React** for the frontend
- **Prisma** as the ORM for database interactions
- **Express.js** for the backend API
- **Multer** for handling file uploads

## How to Run the Project

To run the project, simply open your terminal and execute the following command:

```bash
npm start

```

This single piece of codes starts both frontend and backend functions.
